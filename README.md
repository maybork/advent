## Advent of Code in Scala
This is an attempt at completing as much of AoC2022 as possible using a language I never touched before. I'm doing this as a means to learn Scala as well as a more functional style of programming. Some of these solutions may not be original - I may be looking for hints as I'm not in it to compete, but to learn - I'll source any ideas that helped me.
